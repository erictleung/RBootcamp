# Welcome to the R-Bootcamp!

The R-Bootcamp is meant to be a gentle introduction to manipulating and visualizing data in R using the `tidyverse` suite of packages. Basic programming concepts in R (functions, databases, and control structures) are also covered. Topics covered include:

1. The magic of `ggplot2`.
2. More `ggplot2` using factors.
3. Basic Data Manipulation using `dplyr`.
4. Tidy Data: Why and How using `tidyr`.
5. Control structures: doing one thing many times, making decisions
6. Merging data using `dplyr`.
7. Functions: Why and How.
8. The basics of Databases using `RSQLite`.
9. Advanced Topics
