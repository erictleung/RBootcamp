# Welcome to the R-Bootcamp!

The R-Bootcamp is meant to be a gentle and gradual introduction to manipulating and visualizing data in R using the `tidyverse` suite of packages. Basic programming concepts in R (functions, databases, and control structures) are also covered. Topics covered include:

1. The magic of `ggplot2`.
2. More `ggplot2` using factors.
3. Basic Data Manipulation using `dplyr`.
4. Tidy Data: Why and How using `tidyr`.
5. Simple Statistics using Broom
6. More on using factors
