# Welcome to the R-Bootcamp!

The R-Bootcamp is meant to be a gentle introduction to manipulating and visualizing data in R using the `tidyverse` suite of packages. Basic programming concepts in R (functions, databases, and control structures) are also covered. Topics covered include:

1. Basic Datatypes: `vector` and `data.frame`.
2. Basic Visualization using `ggplot2`.
3. Basic Data Manipulation using `dplyr`.
4. Categorical Data using Factors.
5. Tidy Data: Why and How using `tidyr`.
6. Control structures: doing one thing many times, making decisions
7. Merging data using `dplyr`.
8. Functions: Why and How.
9. The basics of Databases using `RSQLite`.
10. Advanced Topics
